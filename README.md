# MolecularPacking
This public repository to compare the crystal packing similarity from the method described in the [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12548)

It includes the following examples in the format of Jupyter Notebook.

- example-01-Demo, a short example to illustrate the idea of spheric image;
- example-02-PAH, clustering the PAH crystals in 1989 by Desaraju and Gavezotti ([doi: 10.1107/S0108768189003794](https://doi.org/));
- example-03-Shape, clustering the shape examples in 2010 by Motherwell ([doi: 10.1039/C0CE00044B](https://doi.org/10.1039/C0CE00044B)).


To run the Jupyter Notebooks on your own environments, you need to install PyXtal via the following command

```
pip install pyxtal>=0.5.2
conda install -c conda-forge rdkit>=2021.09.2
```
